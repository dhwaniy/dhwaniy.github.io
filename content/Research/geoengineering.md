#### Abstract

Solar geoengineering is a set of emerging technologies that could reduce the effects of global warming. While it has the potential to reduce the consequences of climate change, it cannot replace reducing carbon emissions. In a series of online experiments, we investigate how the framing of geoengineering affects support for carbon taxes. In different frames, we highlight low responsibility for citizens, consequences of geoengineering, and positive impacts of geoengineering.Across studies, we do not find any evidence of geoengineering policies crowding out support for carbon taxes, regardless of how the geoengineering policy is framed.
